## Cross-agent port safety

This skill was ported from Cursor Team Kit for use outside Cursor.

Host-agent rules always win: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, project AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md, sandbox, approval and security policies take priority over this port.

Before running any command that changes files, creates commits/branches/PRs, pushes, installs dependencies, opens browsers, contacts GitHub/CI, or starts long-running services, verify the user's intent and follow the host agent approval model.

Do not run destructive commands, bypass hooks, export secrets, copy browser sessions, send messages, comment, post, join groups, or use stealth/proxy/headless escalation unless the user explicitly asked and the project rules allow it.

Cursor-only concepts such as `Task`, Cursor subagents, Canvas, in-app browser, or Cursor plugin APIs are conceptual in this port. Map them to the current agent's available tools, or stop and explain the limitation.

# Get PR comments

## Trigger

Need a concise, actionable summary of feedback on the active pull request.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the active PR for the current branch.
2. Fetch review comments and discussion comments.
3. Group feedback by severity and actionability.
4. Return a concise action list.

## Output

- Grouped feedback summary
- Action list ordered by priority
- Open questions that still need clarification
