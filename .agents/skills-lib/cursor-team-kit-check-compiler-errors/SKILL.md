description: Cursor Team Kit port: Run compile and type-check commands and report failures

## Cross-agent port safety

This skill was ported from Cursor Team Kit for use outside Cursor.

Host-agent rules always win: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, project AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md, sandbox, approval and security policies take priority over this port.

Before running any command that changes files, creates commits/branches/PRs, pushes, installs dependencies, opens browsers, contacts GitHub/CI, or starts long-running services, verify the user's intent and follow the host agent approval model.

Do not run destructive commands, bypass hooks, export secrets, copy browser sessions, send messages, comment, post, join groups, or use stealth/proxy/headless escalation unless the user explicitly asked and the project rules allow it.

Cursor-only concepts such as `Task`, Cursor subagents, Canvas, in-app browser, or Cursor plugin APIs are conceptual in this port. Map them to the current agent's available tools, or stop and explain the limitation.

# Check compiler errors

## Trigger

Compile or type-check failures are blocking local validation or CI.

## Workflow

1. Run the repo's compile and type-check commands.
2. Summarize errors by file and type.
3. Fix the highest-confidence issues first.
4. Re-run checks until clean or blocked.

## Output

- Current compile and type-check status
- Error summary grouped by file and category
- Fixes applied and remaining blockers
